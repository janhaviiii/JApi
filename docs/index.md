Quality documentation is a hallmark of any healthy software project. For open-source projects, however, 
maintaining a robust compendium of knowledge detailing all the ins and outs is paramount. Well-curated 
documentation increases your project’s approachability, provides asynchronous guidance, and fosters the 
type of uncoordinated collaboration that propels open-source software development.

Hosting your documentation on the web can present time-consuming challenges that make publishing and maintaining it an 
unrewarding experience — one that it’s often easy to avoid. Grappling with multiple disparate publishing tools like 
FTP servers and databases means files often exist in various states and multiple locations, all of which require manual synchronization. To be clear, 
conventional web publishing provides unparalleled flexibility and power; but it comes at the expense of simplicity and, in many cases, utility.
