What We Love About It
It’s hard to point to a single, cool feature of the Stripe API documentation. 
In truth, there aren’t any shiny bells and whistles — and that’s probably what makes 
the Stripe API reference so good. It has all the information you need to get started, presented cleanly and sensibly. The lesson: don’t overdo it.
