# JApi 

An automated backend system.

## ðŸ““ About

JApi is a termianl app written using shell, python and django. It is an easy
way to create your own backend server where the code for the same can also be accessed.
It writes the code automatically depending on the json which is being provided by the 
user. It also provides the user with endpoints depending on the json which is being 
provided by the user. Django along with the Django Rest Framework are used the same. 
We can change the primary keys and can also describe connection between the databses, 
hence establishing a connection. The tables will be autogenerated and it's name and other
details and the table can be changed whenever needed. TUI is made using the package click, 
fascilitating work on the terminal. 
It's major outome and goal is to generate a backend easily and without wiriting much 
code, with ease. Moreover the code for the backend will also be accessible to the user. 
The user can then make changes to the code according to their requirements. This will 
be a helpful tool for developers who do not wish to re-write the same codes and can 
add other important feature like authentication etc to the basic code which is being 
generated using this terminal app.

## ðŸ’¡ Motivation


The idea of this project arose while thinking of how can we make it easier for a 
developer to write backend. For example, if a frontend developer wants to integrate 
backend to their project, they are left with only one option of learning how to 
code it. To make it easier for them, and giving in a basic layout of the 
backend, we came up with this idea to automate Django based on the json given by 
the user. Another usage of this is when an experienced developer wants to make an 
advanced project, they can use this and create a basic layout which they can later 
edit according to their convinience and can add more complex functionalities like 
authentication to the layout. This also saves the time which is wasted in 
re-writing codes.

## ðŸ¤– Tech Stack

Following tech stacks have been used to create this project <br>

<b>React</b><br> Shell, Python, Django and its frameworks along with 
the package Click is used to build this terminal app. 
The algorithm behind the app and the code for establishing the connections 
between the table is written using Python. 


<b>Shell </b><br> Shell is used in run a group of terminal commandas 
automatically using python code which is a pre-requisite. 

<b>Django </b><br> Django along with Django Rest Framework are used to create 
the automated backend server. 
<b>Python </b><br> The algorithm behind the app and the code for establishing 
the connections between the table is written using Python. The package Click is used for TUI.
